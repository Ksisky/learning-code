# My Adventure in Code

##Overview

Hello, my name is Kevin, and I am very new to the programming world. This is a repository of all of the programs I will write to to further my knowledge in code. If I use any code from a book or website, the source will be provided in the folder's README file. I hope anyone else starting out could maybe get some use out of this.

##Running the code.

You will find detailed instruction on how to run the code in the file's directory's README file.

##Fork and modify the code.

If you have a helpful but **basic** modification to one of my programs, please fork the project and submit a pull request, not only will it help me, it will help everyone else reading the code!
